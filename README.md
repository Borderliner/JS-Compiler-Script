# JS-Compiler-Script<br>
A small Shell Script to compile all JS files in a folder using Closure Compiler

###How to use<br>
Just put this file among all your JS files, and run:
<code>./js_compile.sh</code><br>
It will take care of everything and generates x.jsc files.
It will aslo ignore files that contain ".min" or "-min", so you can use it safely.
